# Implementation Status

## Completed

### Phase 1: Skeleton + Front-matter → Cover Page ✓
- Cargo.toml with all dependencies (clap, comrak, docx-rs, serde, serde_yaml, toml, regex, chrono, thiserror)
- `main.rs` — CLI with `build` and `validate` subcommands
- `lib.rs` — public facade: `parse()`, `resolve()`, `render_docx()`, `process()`
- `error.rs` — `LexiconError` enum + `Diagnostic` type
- `model.rs` — full IR types (Document, Clause, InlineContent, etc.)
- `frontmatter.rs` — YAML parsing + date/party validation
- `style.rs` — StyleConfig with TOML loading, page size/margin helpers
- `render/docx.rs` — cover page with title, date, status/version, ref, author, parties block

### Phase 2: Clause Parsing + Legal Numbering ✓
- `parser/mod.rs` — orchestrator: comrak parse → AST walk → IR
- `parser/clause.rs` — recursive clause extraction from nested ordered lists, inline content extraction (bold, italic, links, cross-refs, schedule refs), addendum parsing (headings, paragraphs, tables, bullet lists, clause lists)
- `parser/anchors.rs` — regex-based `{#id}` stripping from text nodes
- `resolve.rs` — clause number assignment (1., 1.1, (a), (i) with roman numerals), anchor→number map, cross-reference resolution
- `render/docx.rs` — clause rendering with headings, legal numbering as text prefixes, indentation per level (720 twips/level), blockquotes, tables, addendum pages with cover headings, exhibit placeholder pages, bullet lists

**Key finding**: comrak produces proper `Heading` nodes inside list `Item` nodes for `1. ## Heading` syntax. Anchors appear as literal text — stripped by regex. Schedule reference links are fully resolved by comrak (URL = `#schedule`, title = value).

### Phase 3: Inline Content + Cross-References + Term Validation ✓
- `resolve.rs` — defined term validation:
  - Classifies bold text as: FormalDefinition (`**Term** means`), InlineDefinition (`("**Term**")`), PartyRole (from front-matter), FieldLabel (`**Label**:`), or Reference
  - Handles grouped definitions (`The terms "**X**", "**Y**" shall have the same meaning...`)
  - Fuzzy matching via multi-variant normalisation (possessives, plurals, verb forms like -ing, -ed, -es, -ies)
  - Filters structural field labels in addenda
  - Cross-reference validation with broken anchor warnings
- Validation output: 10 warnings on example.md, all legitimate (1 undefined `Addendum`, 8 unused US privacy acronyms, 1 unused `include`)

**Note**: `parser/terms.rs`, `parser/references.rs`, and `parser/schedule.rs` were NOT created as separate files. All term detection, cross-reference handling, and schedule item extraction is handled within `parser/clause.rs` (inline extraction) and `resolve.rs` (validation). This is simpler than the original plan since comrak handles most of the heavy lifting during AST parsing.

### Phase 4: Schedule Generation ✓
- `model.rs` — replaced `ScheduleDef` with `ScheduleItem { description, value }`, renamed `schedule_defs` → `schedule_items`
- `resolve.rs` — `collect_schedule_items()` walks entire document (body, addenda) collecting all `ScheduleRef` inline elements
- `render/docx.rs` — "SCHEDULE" page with two-column table (Item | Value), blank items show "____________"

### Phase 5: Styling, TOC, Headers/Footers, Polish ✓
- **Line spacing** — `style.line_spacing` applied as document-wide default via `default_line_spacing()` (Auto rule, value = spacing × 240 twips)
- **Hanging indents** — clause paragraphs with numbers use `SpecialIndentType::Hanging(360)` so wrapped lines align past the number; continuation paragraphs indent to the text position
- **Table of contents** — auto-generated TOC via `TableOfContents` field code with heading styles range 1–3, on its own page after the cover
- **Footer** — ref (italic, left) | Page X of Y (center) | Version N (italic, right) on all pages except the cover page
- **First-page suppression** — empty first-page header/footer so the cover page is clean

## Remaining / Future Work

### Not yet implemented
- **Exhibit URL import** — `path` field with HTTP/HTTPS URLs for fetching remote exhibit files. Phase 3 of exhibit file import.

### Recently completed
- **TOC fixes and consistent heading styling** — fixed apostrophe double-escaping in cached TOC items by building `TableOfContentsItem` entries manually from the Document IR instead of using docx-rs `.auto()` (which reads pre-escaped text from paragraphs and re-escapes it). All section-level headings (Background, Operative Provisions, Addendum, Exhibit, Schedule, Execution) now use Heading1 style with brand colour applied at the style level (not direct run formatting), so TOC entries render in black. Cached TOC items include all heading types in document order, respecting `schedule_position` config.
- **Heading and paragraph spacing** — replaced blank paragraphs around headings with Word native `w:spacing` before/after. New style.toml options: `heading_space_before` (default 18pt), `heading_space_after` (default 12pt), `paragraph_space_before` (default 0pt), `paragraph_space_after` (default 6pt). Heading spacing is set on the Heading1-3 style definitions; paragraph spacing is set on the Normal style. All available as CLI flags.
- **Table page-break prevention** — `cantSplit` applied to all table rows (signatures, schedules, inline tables) to prevent individual rows from splitting across pages. Signature block tables additionally use `keep_next` on all cell paragraphs (plus the intro paragraph and spacer) to keep each entire signature block on one page.
- **Signature page improvements** — new `separate_pages` toggle in `[signatures]` config (default false, CLI flag `--signatures-separate-pages`) puts each party's signature block on its own page. Signatures default to enabled. Execution heading styled as Heading1 and included in TOC.
- **CLI style override flags** — all style.toml options are now available as CLI flags on the `build` subcommand (e.g. `--no-cover`, `--page-size letter`, `--font-family Arial`). Priority: CLI flags > TOML in input dir > TOML in XDG config > built-in defaults. Boolean options use `--flag`/`--no-flag` toggle pairs. Enum values use `clap::ValueEnum` for validation and tab completion. Implemented as a `StyleOverrides` struct flattened into the Build command, with an `apply()` method that patches the loaded `StyleConfig`. Help output is grouped by category (Typography, Page Layout, Cover Page, etc.). Preamble templates and per-party signature overrides remain TOML-only.
- **Man page generation** — `lexicon-docx man --dir <DIR>` generates troff man pages for the main command and all subcommands using `clap_mangen`. Produces `lexicon-docx.1`, `lexicon-docx-build.1`, `lexicon-docx-validate.1`.
- **Native Word cross-references** — cross-references (`[text](#anchor)`) now render as clickable internal hyperlinks in Word, with bookmarks placed at anchor targets (clause headings, first content paragraphs, addendum headings). Uses docx-rs's `Hyperlink::new(name, HyperlinkType::Anchor)` for hyperlinks and `Paragraph::add_bookmark_start/end` for bookmark targets. Bookmark names are sanitised (`lx_` prefix, hyphens → underscores, truncated to 40 chars). Ctrl+click in Word jumps to the referenced clause. No field codes or ZIP post-processing needed.
- **Recitals / Background section** — dedicated section for contract recitals or background, triggered by `# Recitals` or `# Background` heading (case-insensitive). Content supports the same types as the document body. Ordered lists are lettered at the top level: (A), (B), (C) instead of numbered. Sub-levels follow the clause hierarchy pattern: A.1, A.1(a), A.1(a)(i). When recitals are present, a body heading (e.g. `# Operative Provisions`) is required before the operative clauses, ensuring the document remains readable in plain Markdown. Cross-references resolve to "Recital A", "Recital A.1", etc. Defined terms in recitals are validated like the body. New model types: `Recitals` struct, `RecitalTopLevel`/`RecitalClause`/`RecitalSubClause`/`RecitalSubSubClause` variants on `ClauseNumber`. New Word numbering definition with `upperLetter` format at level 0. Spec section 3.9 added.
- **Signature panel layout modes** — two layout modes for signature blocks: "long" (AU/UK/NZ-style, each field is two table rows: writing space with bottom border + label caption below) and "short" (US-style, one row per field with inline label/value). Per-template `layout` field in `signatures.toml` (default "long"). In long mode, `type = "line"` fields get taller writing space (28pt) vs blank fields (16pt). Field labels support `{title}` placeholder expansion for per-signatory captions (e.g. `"{title} Signature"` → "Director Signature"). US templates explicitly set `layout = "short"`; AU/UK/NZ templates updated with caption-style labels.
- **Signature pages** — configurable signature blocks rendered as borderless tables with cell-border signature lines. New `entity_type` field on parties (`{jurisdiction}-{type}` compound string, e.g. `au-company`). Execution method inferred from `type` (Deed → deed, anything else → agreement). Two-layer template system: prose intro with `{placeholder}` substitution + structured field layout. External definitions file (`signatures.toml`) with templates for AU, UK, US, NZ jurisdictions. TOML config: `[signatures]` section with `enabled`, `heading`, `definitions`, `default_template`, and per-party overrides. Template resolution: explicit TOML → definitions file → hardcoded fallback. New modules: `signatures.rs` (template types, loading, resolution), `render/signatures.rs` (docx rendering). See `planning/signature-pages.md`.
- **Schedule refactor (phrase-based detection)** — replaced reference-link syntax (`[display][ref-id]` + `[ref-id]: #schedule "value"`) with phrase-based detection from defined terms. Schedules are declared in front-matter YAML (`schedule: [{title: "Schedule"}]`). Terms whose definition text contains phrases like "has the meaning given by the Schedule" are auto-collected into schedule pages. Multiple schedules supported. Pre-filled values dropped (schedules are always blank for completion). New TOML config: `schedule_order` (`document` or `alphabetical`). Removed `InlineContent::ScheduleRef` from model. Schedule collection and term validation merged into a single pass in `resolve.rs`.
- **Exhibit file import** — optional `path` field on exhibit entries. Supports PNG, JPEG (converted to PNG), and PDF. PDF rendering uses hayro (native Rust). Images are scaled to fit within page margins preserving aspect ratio. Relative paths resolved against the input document's directory. When `path` is omitted, the existing placeholder page behaviour is preserved. New module: `render/exhibit.rs`. Dependencies: `image` 0.25 (PNG/JPEG decode), `hayro` 0.5 (native PDF rendering).
- **Attachment terminology refactor** — renamed "annexures" to three distinct concepts: **Schedule** (inline reference-linked values, unchanged), **Addendum** (body sections with `# ADDENDUM` headings, formerly "ANNEX"), **Exhibit** (front-matter `exhibits` list of external documents, generates placeholder pages with centred title). `Annexure`/`AnnexureContent` types renamed to `Addendum`/`AddendumContent`. Front-matter `annexures: Vec<String>` replaced with `exhibits: Vec<Exhibit>` (objects with `title` field). Addenda are auto-numbered sequentially, case-insensitive heading match, unrecognised `#` headings produce warnings.
- **Configurable defined term style** — `defined_term_style` in style TOML: `bold` (default), `quoted` (curly quotes, no bold), or `bold_quoted`. Applies to all `**bold**` text in body, preamble party roles/type, and custom templates.
- **Parties preamble** — parties preamble block renders before the contract body (independent of cover page). Three styles: `simple` (block layout), `prose` (single flowing paragraph), and `custom` (user-defined templates with `{title}`, `{type}`, `{date}`, `{name}`, `{specifier}`, `{role}` placeholders, `**bold**` markers, `\n` for paragraph breaks). Configured via `[preamble]` section in style TOML. Default disabled.
- **`type` front-matter field** — optional (defaults to "Agreement"), used in preamble text, automatically treated as a defined term.
- **Promoted `title_size` to top-level** — single `title_size` (default 20pt) controls the document title font size for both cover page and inline title. Removed from `[cover]`.
- **Promoted `date_format` to top-level** — single `date_format` (default `%e %B %Y`) used by cover page, preamble, and any future date rendering. Removed from `[cover]`.
- **Centred inline title** — when cover page is disabled, the title is centre-aligned. Status/version and date lines removed (handled by preamble/watermark/footer).
- **Sub-heading numbering styling** — clause numbers on heading paragraphs now inherit bold + heading size via paragraph `rPr`, so `###` sub-heading numbers match the heading text.
- **Simple numbered lists in addenda** — ordered lists without headings or nested sub-lists are now rendered as plain numbered lists (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`) rather than being fed through the clause numbering system.
- **Cover page / TOC toggles** — `[cover] enabled` and `[toc] enabled` in style TOML (default true). Without cover page, an inline title block is rendered. See `planning/cover-page-toc-toggles.md`.
- **Configurable cover page** — `[cover]` section in style TOML: title_size, date_format, between_label, party_format, show_ref, show_author, show_status. See `planning/configurable-cover-page.md`.
- **Footer config** — `[footer]` section in style TOML: show_ref, show_page_number, show_version (appends version to ref). See `planning/footer-and-schedule-config.md`.
- **Schedule position** — `schedule_position` in style TOML: `end` (default, after addenda/exhibits) or `after_toc` (before contract body). See `planning/footer-and-schedule-config.md`.
- **Draft watermark** when `status: draft` — VML WordArt shape injected via ZIP post-processing of the .docx output. See `planning/draft-watermark.md` for details.
- **Native Word numbering** — replaced text-prefix numbers with Word's native numbering engine (`AbstractNumbering` + `Numbering` via docx-rs). See `planning/native-word-numbering.md` for details.

## Architecture Notes

### Processing Pipeline
```
.md input
  → frontmatter.rs: split on ---, serde_yaml deserialize, validate
  → parser/mod.rs: comrak::parse_document → AST
  → parser/clause.rs: recursive AST walk → Document IR
  → resolve.rs: numbering + cross-refs + term validation
  → render/docx.rs: IR → docx-rs → .docx bytes
  → main.rs: write to disk, print diagnostics
```

### Comrak AST Structure (discovered empirically)
```
Document
  List(ordered)           ← top-level clause list
    Item                  ← one per top-level clause
      Heading(level=2)    ← ## heading, with {#anchor} as literal text
      List(ordered)       ← sub-clauses
        Item
          Paragraph       ← clause text with Strong/Link/Text children
          List(ordered)   ← sub-sub-clauses (recursive)
  Heading(level=1)        ← # ADDENDUM headings
  Paragraph               ← prose/addendum content
  Table                   ← markdown tables
```

### Key Design Decisions
- Clause numbers via Word's native numbering engine (`AbstractNumbering` + `Numbering`) — proper hanging indents, automatic counting, Word-native restyling
- Single crate now, structured for workspace extraction later
- comrak resolves reference links during parsing, so `[text][ref-id]` becomes `Link(url="#schedule", title="value")` — the ref-id is lost but title carries the value
- Defined term matching uses multi-variant stemming, not a full NLP stemmer — pragmatic for legal text
